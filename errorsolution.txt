conrext dependency problem
-----------------------------

Steps i took to fix this problem in case if someone encounters it:

 1) Package.json: remove webpack from DevDependencies
 2) rm -R node_modules (remove node_modules folder)
 3) npm i -g webpack
 4) npm i -g webpack-dev-server
 5) remove package-lock.json (if itâ€™s there)
 6) npm i
 7) npm start
